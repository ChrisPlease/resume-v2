Throughout my journey, I've taken on a variety of roles and projects, demonstrating my ability
to adapt and excel. I've led skilled teams, making sure the code is top-notch and guiding
important updates. I've also led big changes in UI projects, showing my leadership and technical
skills. I've explored modern technologies like Web3 and React, driving new ideas in projects
using Ethereum's blockchain while setting good practices. I'm also experienced in managing teams
inside the company and working with different technologies like Vue, React, AWS, and MongoDB.
I've combined design and practicality seamlessly, creating websites that fit what clients want
and making sure they work well for search engines. These different experiences highlight how
dedicated I am to doing great work and finding innovative solutions.
