Bringing over a decade of versatile expertise to the forefront, I am a **seasoned Engineering 
Manager** and **Senior Front-End Engineer** adept at orchestrating high-performing teams and 
driving impactful digital solutions. With a dynamic background spanning UI management and senior 
engineering roles, I have consistently delivered results by harmonizing technical finesse with 
leadership acumen. As a *UI Manager/UI Engineer III*, I've led cross-functional teams, championed 
code quality through hands-on engagement, and navigated complex projects, exemplifying my ability 
to balance strategic vision with hands-on execution.

My proficiency extends beyond management, evident in my role as a *Senior Engineer*, where I have
spearheaded transformative initiatives, from revitalizing legacy systems to pioneering cutting-edge
technologies such as Vue3 and TypeScript. Complemented by my experience as a *Lead Engineer*, I have
a proven track record of driving innovation and establishing best practices in projects involving 
Ethereum blockchain and interactive applications. As your organization seeks a visionary leader who 
can bridge technical excellence with team empowerment, I am poised to contribute my expertise as 
an Engineering Manager or Senior Front-End Engineer.
