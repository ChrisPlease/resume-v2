For over 10 years, I've excelled as a front-end engineer, specializing in modern single-page 
applications. My objective is to secure a senior-level position where I can leverage my 
expertise, contribute as a key team member, continue writing code, and mentor junior 
developers. I am particularly passionate about championing best practices in unit testing, 
ensuring accessibility in every facet of development, and staying abreast of the latest 
trends in modern styling. My goal is to bring these passions to a dynamic team, fostering 
a culture of code quality, inclusivity, and cutting-edge design in every project.
